# VATUSA Chicago ARTCC and VATUSA Minneapolis ARTCC Letter of Agreement
###### EFFECTIVE: 04/15/2015
## SUBJECT: Interfacility Coordination

1. __PURPOSE:__ This agreement establishes coordination procedures and defines delegation of airspace between VATUSA Chicago ARTCC (ZAU) and VATUSA Minneapolis ARTCC (ZMP). This agreement is supplemental to procedures contained within FAA Order 7110.65.
2. __DISCLAIMER:__ Information contained herein is designed and specifically for use in a virtual air traffic control environment. It is not applicable, nor should it be referenced for live operations in the National Airspace System (NAS).
3. __CANCELLATION:__ VATUSA Chicago ARTCC and VATUSA Minneapolis ARTCC Letter of Agreement dated January 15, 2011.
4. __RESPONSIBILITIES:__
    1. ZMP delegates to ZAU control jurisdiction of airspace in the vicinity of Volk Field, WI (VOK) and Waterloo, IA (ALO) as depicted in [Attachment A](sections/attachment-a.md) and [Attachment B](sections/attachment-b.md).
    2. ZAU delegates to ZMP control jurisdiction of airspace in the vicinity of Des Moines, IA (DSM) as depicted in [Attachment C](sections/attachment-c.md).
5. __PROCEDURES:__
    1. Each ARTCC must route/restrict aircraft in accordance with [Attachment D](sections/attachment-d.md).
    2. Transponder codes may be changed without coordination in an area 30NM either side of the ZMP/ZAU ARTCC common boundary, and the receiving controller must have control for turns up to 20 degrees left or right of course for aircraft within 20NM of the ZMP/ZAU ARTCC common boundary.
    3. For RNAV aircraft landing C90 area airports, Chicago ARTCC must have control for configuration-dependent STAR reroutes within 30NM of the ARTCC common boundary.
    4. Flights originating less than 5 minutes flying time from the adjacent ARTCC’s boundary must be coordinated by the transferring ARTCC.
    5. Aircraft whose destination airports lie within 60 miles of the ZMP/ZAU ARTCC common boundary must enter the receiving ARTCC’s airspace AOB FL230, and the receiving ARTCC must have control for descent and turns.
    6. Routes/restrictions listed in [Attachment E](sections/attachment-e.md) must apply upon request of the receiving ARTCC for events or periods of heavy arrival or departure traffic to or from the designated airport.
    7. Data Block Coordination and Interim Altitude Procedures.
        1. Data blocks must reflect the aircraft’s assigned altitude at the time of handoff.
        2. Handoffs must be directed to the appropriate sector for the aircraft’s altitude assignment. Acceptance of a radar handoff constitutes approval coordination for that aircraft to climb or descend to the displayed altitude.
        3. Use of interim (temp) altitudes is authorized between Chicago ARTCC and Minneapolis ARTCC and must represent valid altitude coordination. Use of interim altitudes must not be authorized to coordinate Inappropriate Altitude for Direction of Flight (IAFDOF), or to supersede altitude restrictions established within this Letter of Agreement.
        4. When unable to approve the automated altitude, the receiving controller must verbally coordinate with the transferring controller prior to acceptance of the handoff.
    8. Aircraft unable to comply with required routes or altitude must be coordinated with the receiving ARTCC on an individual basis.
